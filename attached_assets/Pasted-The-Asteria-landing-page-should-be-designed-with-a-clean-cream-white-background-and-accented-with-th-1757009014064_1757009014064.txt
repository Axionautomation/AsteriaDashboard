The Asteria landing page should be designed with a clean cream white background and accented with the brand’s soft orange (#F2583A), creating a modern and welcoming aesthetic. At the top, a sticky navigation bar keeps the logo on the left, a simple menu in the center (Home, How It Works, Plans, About), and a clear login and sign-up button on the right. The sign-up button should be bold in orange with a subtle hover glow, ensuring it always draws attention. Smooth animations should guide users naturally as they scroll, with fade-ins, parallax effects, and hovering motion to keep the experience lively without feeling distracting.

The hero section introduces Asteria with a full-screen design. A strong headline states, “Predictable AI Monitoring for No-Code Workflows,” followed by subtext explaining the value: “Asteria ensures your n8n and API automations run flawlessly. Monitor latency, detect failures, and get real-time alerts — all without writing code.” A large orange button labeled “Start Free Trial” sits beside a secondary “See Plans” button, encouraging immediate engagement. The hero visual should show a dashboard with flowing nodes or workflow diagrams, animated to float slightly for depth and dynamism.

Scrolling down, the How It Works section explains the process in three simple steps, arranged in a horizontal timeline. Step one is Connect, where users link their n8n or API workflow. Step two is Monitor, where Asteria automatically analyzes every run. Step three is Get Alerts, which highlights real-time notifications for errors, latency spikes, or unexpected outputs. Each step should have its own animated icon and expand with details when hovered. Supporting cards underneath highlight specific benefits like latency monitoring, diagnostics for tool failures, and detection of unexpected outputs.

The next section presents Plans and Pricing in three clear tiers, with animated pricing cards that lift on hover and animate the token counts upward when visible. The Starter Plan is $10 per month for 100 workflow runs, the Growth Plan is $100 per month for 1,000 runs, and the Pro Plan is $500 per month for 10,000 runs. Each plan clearly lists what’s included, from monitoring and diagnostics to alerts and reporting. A bright orange “Choose Plan” button ensures the path to purchase is simple and clear.

The final About section builds trust with visitors. It begins with Asteria’s mission statement: “Asteria makes AI monitoring scalable and reliable. Built for teams that need peace of mind when automating with no-code tools.” This is followed by a row of recognizable integration logos like n8n, Zapier, and standard API icons. A short carousel of testimonials gives credibility and real-world reassurance. The section ends with a bold closing statement: “Ready to stop guessing and start knowing?” paired with a large orange “Sign Up Now” button. The footer contains standard links for documentation, support, privacy, and terms, along with social icons styled in orange outlines.

Throughout the site, the login and sign-up modal should be sleek and consistent. When clicked, it opens as a white card accented with soft orange highlights and animated input fields that respond on focus. Users should be able to sign up via email and password or with OAuth options like Google and GitHub.
